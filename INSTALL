Requirements
============

You need to have the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) installed.
This should be available in your standard package repository.


Installing
==========

To compile tokamak_draw:

./configure
make

Then optionally:

make install

By default, make install will put tokamak_draw in /usr/local/bin
but to change this use the --prefix configure option e.g.:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/

For other configuration options run

./configure --help
