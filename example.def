# Example model definition
# 
# Syntax: 
#  name <decription>   (optional)
#  <Default settings>
#
#  <item>
#     <settings>
#  <item>
#     <settings>
#    ...
#
# Settings can be any of
#   ALPHA <number> Transparency
#   COLOR <name or 3 numbers between 0 and 1> 
#      e.g. "COLOR blue" or "COLOR 0.0 0.0 1.0"
#   ELONGATION <number>
#   MAJOR <number>   - Major radius
#   MINOR <number>   - Minor radius
#   NUMBER <integer>  Number of field-lines, or resolution
#   PITCH <integer m> <integer n> Field-line pitch
#   RANGE <start and end angles>
#      e.g. "RANGE 0 90"
#   TRIANGULARITY <number> 
#   
# These can be abbreviated so long as they're not ambiguous
# so you could use "C", "E", "MA", "MI", "N", "P", "R", "T"
# but that's not recommended for clarity
#
# Numbers can be specified either as an absolute value,
# or relative to the defaults. e.g. You could specify
# "ELONGATION 0.2" to set to 0.2, or "+0.1" to set to
# the default value + 0.1.
#
# NOTE: Not case sensitive, indentation optional, and
#       hash starts a comment.
