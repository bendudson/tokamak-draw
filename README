Bundled code
============

Uses GL2PS by Christophe Geuzaine <geuz@geuz.org> to produce PostScript output

Example
=======

To generate an example input file, run

$ tokamak_draw example

This will produce a file 'example.def', which defines a model to draw.
The syntax of this file is quite simple, and by changing this you
can specify different models to draw.

Just running without any arguments

$ tokamak_draw

will try to read from 'example.def', but you can specify a different file
to read as the first argument e.g:

$ tokamak_draw my_model.def

When viewing a model, pressing 'h' or '?' gives a list of commands.
Pressing 'q' or ESC exits.
